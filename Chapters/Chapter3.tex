\section{Dataset}
In this thesis, we use Standford Sentiment Treebank (SST) dataset \cite{socher2013recursive}. Standford Sentiment Treebank contains 11,855 sentences. Each data sentence consist of fined-grain sentiment labeled phrases in constituency parse tree structure (see \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:sst}}). There are total 215,154 phrases in whole dataset. 
The dataset was splitted into train/dev/test contain 8544/1101/2210 sentences each for training and evaluation models. After remove neutral sentiment sentences, there are 6920/872/1821 sentences remained in train/dev/test set.

SST dataset are publicly available online \footnote{https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html}.
