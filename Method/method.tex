\hypertarget{chap:method}{\chapter{Method}}\label{method}
In this section, we introduce our methods for improving the accuracy of sentiment classification task on \hyperref[sec:sst]{Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset with binary setting}.
In search of new improvements, we have tried three different approaches:
\begin{description}
\item[\deschyperlink{sec:VTtree}{Utilizing local syntactic information at each node of Recursive Neural Networks}] The first approach is mainly based on the success of Tag Embeddings Recursive Neural Networks~\cite{tag-embedding-rnn}.
In this paper, the authors parameterized the composition functions at each parse tree's node with respect to the grammar rule expanding that node.
By doing so, the authors were able to not only efficiently improve the performance of RNTN (Socher, 2013)~\cite{socher2013recursive} (from \(85.4\%\) to \(87.7\%\) accuracy) but also use much smaller number of parameters in their models \((54K)\) compared to that of RNTN \((108K)\)~\cite{tag-embedding-rnn}.
Given the success of \hyperref[sec:treelstm]{Tree-LSTM models}, we hypothesized that by parameterized the composition functions of a Tree-LSTMs unit at a node with respect to the grammar rule expanding that node, we can improve the performance of Tree-LSTMs (in the same way how this method improves RNTN).

\textbf{This approach was later proven to be unsuccessful}, so we tried two more different approaches.

\item[\deschyperlink{sec:Glove-Amazon}{Transfer Learning by retraining Glove on Amazon Reviews dataset}] \label{movie-hypothesis} There are many words (e.g. "B-rated", "Batman", "Nolan", "cartoonlike") which rarely appears in regular documents but more often in movie reviews.
We hypothesized that by training word embeddings of review documents, especially movie or book reviews, we can capture more rare words and also the different way people use words (or different word relationships) to express their opinions on movies or books.
For archiving these purposes, we retrained Glove vectors~\cite{glove} on part of  \hyperref[sec:amazon]{Amazon Reviews dataset}.
This new Glove word vectors was named Glove Amazon.
For evaluating Glove Amazon, we replaced the Glove Common Crawl\footnote{Common Crawl (840B tokens, 2.2M vocab, cased, 300d vectors, 2.03 GB download) publicly available at \url{https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/}} with Glove Amazon for initializing Tree-LSTMs' word embedding layer.

\textbf{In spite of being a simple method, Glove Amazon dramatically improves Tree-LSTMs performance.}
This is our first successful method for transfer learning from document-level (Amazon Reviews) to sentence-level labeled dataset (Stanford Sentiment Treebank).
Inspired by this approach, we cooperated it into the development of our next approach.

\item[\deschyperlink{sec:CNNtree}{Combining Recursive Neural Networks with Convolution Neural Networks}] \label{conv-tree-benefits} Based on our discussion on tree-structured versus sequential network architects (Sec.\ref{sec:tree-discuss}) and the benefits of using convolution layer (Sec.\ref{kim-cnn}), we combined Convolution Neural Networks with Tree-LSTM and \hyperref[sec:lstm]{sequential LSTM}.
We hypothesized that the convolution layer will help Tree-LSTMs to mitigate the problem of lacking local context and weak feature capturing at leaf nodes (Sec.\ref{sec:tree-discuss}).
Additionally, using Tree-LSTM to combine the feature maps produced by convolution layer is better than max-over-time pooling layer (Sec.\ref{kim-drawback}).
The increased model complexity can lead to over-fitting.
We tackled this risk by unsupervised pre-training the models on the large Amazon Reviews dataset using methods described in Sec.\ref{sec:unsupervised-pretrain}.
Based on the success of Glove Amazon, we expected that the unsupervised pre-training process (on Amazon Reviews) help the models to capture not only generic language features but also specific knowledge about Film industry and human culture (Sec.\ref{sec:nlm}).

With this approach, \textbf{we was able to archive state-of-art\footnote{July, 2017} performance on Stanford Sentiment Treebank}.

\subsubsection{Embedding layer}\label{sec:embedding}
Embedding layer is a lookup table that converts input data (such as text) into its vector representation. Word embedding layer parameters are its embedding matrix $M  \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, where $n$ and $d$ are vocabulary size and embedding vector dimension, respectively. In practical, an embedding layer also comes with a vocabulary-index lookup table, which maps words with indexes, which has vector representation corresponding to the row in word embedding matrix.

The following steps are required once for each experiment:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Build vocabulary-index lookup table
    \item Init/Load word embedding matrix corresponding to vocabulary-index table
    \item Convert every sentence in dataset into indices using vocabulary-index table
\end{itemize}
Usually, indices are kept as dataset. Raw dataset (such as readable words) are discarded to free up memory. For each mini-batch, we use indices to look up word representation vector from embedding matrix. Embedding matrix represents of each sentence in dataset are not saved and needed look-up every mini-batch for the following reason.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Saved embedding matrix for each data sentences cost more memory than saving only indices and look-up in embedding layer.
    \item Embedding matrix contains trainable parameters and being updated every iteration.
\end{itemize}

Fig.\ref{fig:embeddinglayer} illustrates embedding layer component and describes the process of convert raw data sentence into its word representation.

    \label{fig:embeddinglayer}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{TE-Tree-GRU}
We applied both tree structure network and recurrent structure in our model.
In each sub-tree, which consists of one parent node with or without children, we applied recurrent network structure over current node and all its child.
We stored the last hidden layer as node intermediate information and use as input to higher level.
For network unit, we chose \hyperref[sec:GRU]{Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)}~\cite{cho2014learning}.
GRU transition equations used in our implementation are describe in Eq.\ref{eq:gru}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gru}
\begin{aligned}
&r = sigmoid(W_{ir} x + b_{ir} + W_{hr} h + b_{hr}) \\
&i = sigmoid(W_{ii} x + b_{ii} + W_{hi} h + b_{hi}) \\
&n = \tanh(W_{in} x + b_{in} + r * (W_{hn} h + b_{hn})) \\
&h' = (1 - i) * n + i * h\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Constituency TE-Tree-GRU} \label{sec:VTtreeConstituency}
For each sub-tree, we sorted child node from left to right order. We took node state k, node POS-tag, and parent POS-tag as input for GRU time step. We put parent node at the end of GRU chain. We took hidden state of the last time step as node state k for parent node. For each sub-tree (Fig.\ref{fig:treecp}), model is illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:cvtgru}. For leaf node case, we inputted word and tag into GRU and got hidden output h as k for leaf node as Fig.\ref{fig:gruleaf}.

\subsubsection{Dependency TE-Tree-GRU} \label{sec:VTtreeDependency}
We built a model similar to constituency case, with a chain GRU for each sub tree. However, we did not put parent node at the end of the chain. Instead, parent node and child node were sorted according to their position in sentences. We took node state k, node POS-tag, node dependency relationship type vs head word as input for GRU time step. At parent node, we set dependency relationship type is 'self' and node states k set to zeros vector. We took hidden state of the last time step as node state k for parent node. In case of leaf node, we treated it as parent node without children. We built GRU chain with only parent node for leaf case. Fig.\ref{fig:dependencyvtgru} illustrates Dependency TE GRU model.

\subsubsection{Output layer and loss function}
We used softmax classifier and cross entropy loss function as described in~\cite{treeLSTM}.  
For each parent labeled node, we used node state $k$ as input to output layer and calculate loss against given label. 
Root node state $k$ was used to determine sentiment of whole sentences.

\hypertarget{sec:Glove-Amazon}{\section{Training Glove embedding on Amazon reviews dataset}}
\label{sec:gloveamazone}
We named this word embeddings Glove Amazon.
Apart from using Glove Amazon to replace Glove Common Crawl for initializing word embedding layer of Tree-LSTM, the whole training process and hyper-parameters are kept unchanged (Sec.\ref{sec:treelstm}).

For this approach, we do experiment with two network architects:
\begin{description}
\item[CNN Tree-LSTM] Given the Constituency Tree-LSTM architect described in Sec.\ref{sec:treelstm},  we inserted a convolution layer between the word embedding layer and the Tree-LSTM's leaf-module.
The rest of TreeLSTM implementation was kept unchanged.
A diagram of CNN Tree-LSTM's modules can be found in Fig.\ref{fig:convtreelstmsummary}.
\item[CNN LSTM] Similar CNN Tree-LSTM but the Tree-LSTM module is replaced by a LSTM.\footnote{Although CNN LSTM seems similar to \hyperref[cnn-rnn]{CNN-RNN}~\cite{cnn-rnn}, we extended it for multichannel input and unsupervised pre-train it. We will explain these techniques in more details in Sec.\ref{sec:model-enhan}}
One advantage of CNN-LSTM compared to CNN Tree-LSTM is that CNN-LSTM can be unsupervised pre-trained as Language Model, while CNN Tree-LSTM can not (Sec.\ref{sec:unsupervised-pretrain}).
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Convolution layer} \label{sec:conv1c}
Our implementation is based on the convolution layer described in Sec.\ref{kim-cnn}.
\paragraph{Matrix presentation of sequences of words}
Let denote \(\bm{x_i \in \mathbb{R}^k}\) as a \(\bm{k}\)-dimension vector presentation of word-\(\bm{i}\)th in a sentence.
Note that the first word in a sentence is word-\(\bm{0}\)th, if the sentence is padded with dummy words on its left, these padded dummy words are indexed by negative integers.
Given a sentence \(\bm{s}\) of length \(\bm{n}\), we can present a sub-sequence of words in the sentence which start at word-\(\bm{i}\)th and end at word-\(\bm{j}\)th as:
\begin{align}
    X_{i:j} &= x_i \oplus x_{i+1} \oplus ... \oplus x_{j} &\label{concat}
\end{align}
In Eq.\eqref{concat}, \(\bm{\oplus}\) is concatenation operator which result in the matrix \(\bm{X_{i:j} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times (j-i+1)}}\).

\paragraph{Convolution filter}
Given \(\bm{F}\) is the set of filters of the convolution layer and the filter \(\bm{v \in F}\) which has window of size \(\bm{l}\) and set of parameters \(\bm{\theta^{(v)} = \{ W^{(v)}, b^{(v)} | W^{(v)} \in \mathbb{R}^{l \times d}, b^{(v)} \in \mathbb{R}\}}\), filter \(\bm{v}\) is applied on a sequence of word-\(\bm{i}\)th to word-\(\bm{(i+l-1)}\)th through the following equation:
\begin{align}
    c^{(v)}_j &= f(W^{(v)} \otimes X_{i:i+l-1} + b^{(v)}) &\label{filter}
\end{align}

In Eq.\eqref{filter}, operator \(\bm{\otimes}\) is the Hadamard product~\cite{element-prod}.  
\(\bm{b \in \mathbb{R}}\) as bias term and \(\bm{f}\) is an activation function.
For indexing, \(j = i + x\) with \(x \in \mathbb{N}\) and \((0 \leq x \leq l - 1)\).
If half-padding policy is employed then \(j = i + \floor{\frac{l}{2}}\).
For the case of multichannel input, given that the sentence is presented by a set of input channels \(\bm{Z}\).
We will modify Eq.\eqref{filter} as follow:
\begin{align}
    \forall h \in Z, \; \; \hat{c}^{(v)}_{jh} &= f(W^{(v)} \otimes X_{i:i+l-1} + b^{(v)})& \\
    c^{(v)}_j &= \sum_{h \in Z} \hat{c}^{(v)}_{jh}&
\end{align}

By slicing the filter \(\bm{v}\) through the sentence (i.e. applying the filter \(\bm{v}\) on different sequences of length \(\bm{l}\) along the sentence) we can get vector \(\bm{c^{(v)} = [c^{(v)}_0, c^{(v)}_1~\cdots]}\) which is a feature map of the sentence \(\bm{s}\).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figure/cnn-module}
    \caption[Convolution layer with two input channels]{Convolution layer with two input channels}
    \label{fig:cnn-module}
\end{figure}

Until now, we have not define the length of the feature map \(\bm{c^{(v)}}\). 
To be able to work with Tree-LSTM (which required tree-structured inputs), all the feature maps produced by the convolution layer need to have length equal to that of the sentence \(\bm{s\)} (which is \(\bm{n}\) in this case).
For satisfying this constraint, all filters in \(Z\) are restricted to have odd window sizes and being applied on the sentence according to half padding, unit strides policy~\cite{conv-arith}.
These conditions entail \(\bm{\forall u \in Z,  c^{(u)} \in \mathbb{R}^n}\)~\cite{conv-arith}.
We demonstrate this policy in Fig.\ref{fig:half-padding}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{figure/half-padding}
    \caption[Half padding, unit strides policy]{A convolution filter with window size 3 applying on a sentence according to half padding, unit strides policy.
    The length of the resulted feature map is equal to that of the sentence.}
    \label{fig:half-padding}
\end{figure}


Suppose the size of set of filters \(F\) is \(m\), all the feature maps produced by the set of filters is then concatenated into one matrix \(P \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}\), which each of its row is a feature maps.
After that, the column vectors of \(P\) (which have length \(m\)) are treated as input vectors for TreeLSTM or any Recurrent Neural Network.


\subsection{Models enhancements}\label{sec:model-enhan}
\subsubsection{Training Glove embedding on Amazon reviews dataset}\label{sec:reuse-glove-amazon}
We reused Glove Amazon word embedding (Sec.\ref{sec:gloveamazone}).

\subsubsection{Using multi-channel word embeddings}\label{sec:enhan-multi-channel}
This method was introduced by Yoon Kim~\cite{KimCNN}.
The description and analysis of this method can be found in Sec.\ref{kim-cnn}.
Although in his paper, in the training process of his 2-channel-CNN, Kim updated one channel and kept the other unchanged, we are not restricted ourselves to this rule.
The type of word embeddings used in each channel, the number of channels and the method for updating each channel are treated as hyper-parameters.

This method allows multiple parallel embedding layers in our model.
In other words, each word is presented by multiple vector representations.

\subsubsection{Pre-training models on Amazon reviews dataset}
\label{enhan-unsupervised-pretrain}
We presented several methods for unsupervised pre-training neural network models and given some hypotheses on the beneficial effects of these methods in Sec.\ref{sec:unsupervised-pretrain}.
