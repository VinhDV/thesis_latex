\section{Feedforward neural network}
Feedforward neural network is a network whether unit in the graph does not form a cycle \cite{Goodfelloetal2016}. 

Each feedforward neural network consist of one or multiple layer. Each layer contain one or more neurons (network nodes). Each neuron consist of a linear activation or non-linear activation function. 

\subsection{Singlelayer perceptron}
Singlelayer perceptron is a feedforward neural network only have one layer of neuron unit.  Singlelayer perceptron cannot solve some problem such as XOR.

\subsection{Multilayer perceptron}
Multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a feedforward neural network consist of 2 or more layer. First layer called input layer. Last layer called output layer. All layer between input and output layer are hidden layer.
